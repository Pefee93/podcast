    description1="Gloriya a.k.a GAMMA is a musician from Bulgaria. Creativity and art in many forms are an output for her spirituality and phillosophy."
    description2="In her country she is known for jazzy melancholic covers of underground hip hop songs. Out of many songs she is constantly creating, GAMMA releases a very minimal part of the music saying 'I believe this has something to do with my understanding of intimacy between the live performer and the listener.'"
    description3='The most intimate way to connect with the people is through live performances. This is something you cannot hear or see or feel online.'
