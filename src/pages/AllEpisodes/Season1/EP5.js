      description2='Ego was formed in Nis, Serbia in 2009 as a result of great love and obsession with music. Today, this band is eagerly awaiting the "Mechanisms": album release accompanied by punchy guitar riffs, energetic rhythm, and vocals that fluctuate between angry and melancholic. They have just released their debut single "Hypnotech"!'
