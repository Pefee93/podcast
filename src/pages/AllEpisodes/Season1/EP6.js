      description1='This is a third episode from the Stellar Live Series. We are exploring songwriting with Milan, a songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist from the alternative rock band Ego.'
      description2='Ego was formed in Nis, Serbia in 2009 as a result of great love and obsession with music. Today, this band is eagerly awaiting the "Mechanisms": album release accompanied by punchy guitar riffs, energetic rhythm, and vocals that fluctuate between angry and melancholic. They have just released their debut single "Hypnotech"!'
